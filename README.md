I developed this code using python

Initially I initialize the values number of requests and time as zeros.
I have also kept the record of last allowed time so that I can see whether any request is allowed or not with a window of S seconds from present time. If there is window of S seconds then I assigned zero to number of requestes allowed.

I allowed a request only if number of reguests allowed in last S seconds is less than R else blocked it
